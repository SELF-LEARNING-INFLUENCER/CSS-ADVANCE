CSS Transition:
Normally when the value of a CSS property changes, the rendered result is instantly updated
A common example is changing the background color of a button on mouse hover. In a normal 
scenario the background color of the button is changes immediately from the old property 
value to the new property value when you place the cursor over the button.
CSS3 introduces a new transition feature that used to change the element gradually 
from one style to another, without using flash or JavaScript.
You should specify two things to create CSS transition.
The CSS property on which you want to add an effect.
The time duration of the effect.
